# MyPortfolioMVC
A simple website portfolio (well, it's a desktop).

## Used Technologies
1. ASP.NET Core MVC
2. C#
3. JavaScript
4. W3.CSS
5. HTML
6. Line Awesome
7. Google Icons

## Website Capabilities
1. Support multiple languages.
2. Mobile support despite being desktop focused (just like Windows 10+).

That's what I can think right now...
